## Installation
To install the bot, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm i reciple
```
```bash
yarn add reciple
```
```bash
pnpm add reciple
```

You can initialize the bot to the current directory with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx reciple
```

It will ask you to continue if the directory is not empty. Type `y` to continue. After the bot has been initialized, it will ask you for your bot token.

> You can change the token anytime you want

## Config

You can configure the bot in `reciple.yml` located in the bot's root directory.

### Token

You can directly change the token in `reciple.yml`.

```yml
token: "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

Using environment variables is also supported.

```yml
token: "env:TOKEN_VARIABLE"
```

You can override the given token using your terminal

```bash
npx reciple --token "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## Starting the bot
To start the bot, run the following command:

```bash
npx reciple
```

> ## Fun Fact
> The name reciple is from a minecraft bug. The bug was a misspelling of the word `recipe`. [View Mojang Bug Report](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-225837)
